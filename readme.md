# Housing Price Predictor

This was kind of a practice project I made for learning machine learning and making guis. The model has been trained on the data in the `melb_data.csv` file. To run the gui, download the source code from the github release and run the `gui.py` file, input the number of rooms, bathrooms, landsize, latitude, and longitude. The model will predict the price of the house based on these features and output it.
